# Pirate-Intelligent-Agent

I was presented with code for a randomly generated maze containing a treasure chest somewhere within the maze. The game is intended to be played with a human user attempting to reach the treasure in the maze before the pirate intelligent agent. I added the code that enables the intelligent agent to train itself by playing the game against itself over and over, learning from each iteration. I used reinforcement techniques to give positive feedback when taking actions that brought the agent closer to its goal and negative feedback for actions that were repeated pathways or attempts to move through the walls of the maze.

Through this project I aim to demonstrate the use of neural networks to train an intelligent agent to perform tasks with efficiency and accuracy. To achieve this a data scientist must consider the impact of biases that may be present throughout the training. Working to limit these biases is necessary for reducing and illiminating harmful outcomes for users and third party individuals. It is important to approach problems with security, safety, and functionality in mind. It is important to always be mindful of the impact the system may have people as a whole, as well as specific communitites.
